## Applications

### Media
There are 49 applications that include media in apps.applicationmedia and encompases a mixed set of YouTube videos and
static images.  The media is stored on the webserver in a cache of some sort and it will be easier to just enter these
by hand than it will be to write an import script.  It will also serve to let us take a more sensible pass on how media
is displayed in the final site.
